Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following: D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal

net_amount = 0
while True:
str = raw_input ("Enter transaction: ")
transaction = str.split(" ")
type = transaction [0]
amount = int (transaction [1])
if type=="D" or type=="d":
net_amount += amount
elif type=="W" or type=="w":
net_amount -= amount
else:
pass
str = raw_input ("want to continue (Y for yes) : ")
if not (str[0] =="Y" or str[0] =="y") :
break
print "Net amount: ", net_amount
Output
Enter transaction: D 10000
want to continue (Y for yes) : Y
Enter transaction: W 5000
want to continue (Y for yes) : Y
Enter transaction: D 2000
want to continue (Y for yes) : Y
Enter transaction: W 100
want to continue (Y for yes) : N
Net amount: 6900
